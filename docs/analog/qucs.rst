Design using Qucs-S
=====================================
Qucs-S (Quite Universal Circuit Simulator - SPICE) is a fork of the Qucs project that integrates SPICE simulation capabilities. Unlike the original Qucs, which uses its own solver, 
Qucs-S allows users to simulate circuits using a variety of SPICE engines like Ngspice, XYCE, or any other SPICE-compatible simulator. This makes it versatile for both analog and 
digital circuit simulation. Qucs-S maintains the same graphical user interface (GUI) as Qucs, enabling schematic capture, simulation, and waveform viewing in a user-friendly environment, 
but with the added flexibility of SPICE simulation. Qucs-S has also a "look & feel" like a proprietary ADS tool.
